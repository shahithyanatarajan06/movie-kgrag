## ✨ Motivation

Traditional recommendation systems rely heavily on vector similarity or static filters.

This project explores a **Graph + LLM hybrid approach**, where:

- 🧠 Groq LLM extracts user intent from natural language
- 🕸 Neo4j graph database models relationships between Movies, Genres, Actors
- ⚡ Streamlit provides a clean interactive UI

The goal is to demonstrate how **LLMs + Graph Databases** can work together in real-world applications.

---

## 🔥 Key Features

- ✅ Natural language queries ("recommend movies like Inception")
- ✅ Graph-based similarity using Neo4j relationships
- ✅ Recommendations by:
  - Similar movie
  - Genre
  - Actor
  - Top-rated
- ✅ Intent extraction via Groq LLaMA model
- ✅ Interactive Streamlit interface
- ✅ Clean modular architecture (LLM layer + DB layer + UI layer)

### Graph Schema

- (:Movie)
- (:Genre)
- (:Actor)

Relationships:

- (:Movie)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(:Genre)
- (:Movie)-[:ACTED_IN]<-(:Actor)

---

## 🎥 Demo

Example queries:

```bash
recommend movies like inception
top rated movies
action movies
movies by leonardo dicaprio
```

Example output:

```
Interstellar
Tenet
The Matrix
Shutter Island
```

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- Python 3.9+
- Neo4j Desktop or Neo4j Aura
- Groq API Key
- Git

Python libraries:

- streamlit
- neo4j
- groq
- python-dotenv (optional)

---

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender-graph.git
cd movie-recommender-graph
```

---

### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password
```

---

### 5️⃣ Load Movie Data into Neo4j

```bash
python load_data.py
```

---

### 6️⃣ Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

Type natural language queries like:

```text
recommend movies like inception
```

```text
top rated movies
```

```text
romantic movies
```

```text
movies by tom hanks
```

The system automatically:

1. Extracts structured intent via Groq
2. Runs graph queries in Neo4j
3. Returns recommended movies

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Environment Variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|------------|
| GROQ_API_KEY | Your Groq API key |
| NEO4J_URI | Neo4j database URI |
| NEO4J_USER | Neo4j username |
| NEO4J_PASSWORD | Neo4j password |

Optional:
- Modify `llm.py` to change LLM model
- Modify `db.py` to customize Cypher queries

---
